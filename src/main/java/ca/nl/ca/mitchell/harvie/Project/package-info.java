/**
 * Java package for the project.
 * This project extends the initial Invoice System assignment into a fully-featured application. The system
 * models real-world invoicing by introducing collections for multiple invoice items, abstract classes with
 * inheritance, and customer management. Additionally, it calculates sales tax and provides a well-
 * formated output of the invoice, making the system more realistic and comprehensive.
